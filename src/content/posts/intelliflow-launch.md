## Situation
By day I work in infrastructure: Linux, virtualization, and cloud platforms. I like things organized, but somehow my own finances were total chaos. I wanted something simple, secure, synchronized across devices, with an easy-to-use interface and advanced AI features.

I decided to learn Android development. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I used AI to speed up the boring parts: project setup, repetitive boilerplate, and scaffolding.

## Solution
This approach let me spend my time where it matters most and where I am the most knowledgeable: architecture, security, and reliability.

What I focused on:
- Google Cloud architecture designed for resilience.
- Firestore & Cloud Functions locked down with strict access controls.
- IAM and PAM policies to ensure least-privilege access.
- Payment validation and end-to-end access control.
- Monitoring setup to catch errors early.

## Outcome
AI didn't "build" the app for me. It handled tedious tasks so I could apply infrastructure best practices and security thinking from day one.

The result: a leaner development flow and an app I trust to run safely in production. It features AI categorization, pattern detection, and cross-device sync. 

If you're in infrastructure and curious about app development, try letting AI take care of the repetitive work, then use your domain expertise to make the system robust.
